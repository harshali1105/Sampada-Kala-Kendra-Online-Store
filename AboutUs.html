                <p>Namaste Everyone!! I am Sanjay Dabholkar, the founder and Art Director of Sampada Kala Kendra. Since childhood, I have
                    been
                    deeply
                    connected to the art and spirituality that surround Lord Ganesha. I started this journey with a
                    vision to
                    keep
                    our traditions alive while protecting the environment.<br><br>

                    At Sampada Kala Kendra, every Ganesha idol is lovingly handcrafted using red soil or clay (shadu).
                    This
                    decision
                    wasn’t just about tradition—it’s my way of giving back to nature. I’ve seen how plaster-of-Paris
                    idols harm
                    our
                    water bodies, and I felt a strong need to change that. By using eco-friendly materials, we ensure
                    that the
                    idols
                    dissolve easily in water without causing pollution.<br><br>

                    Every idol we create tells a story of devotion, creativity, and sustainability. Our team of talented
                    artisans
                    works tirelessly to bring unique designs to life, each one reflecting the beauty of our cultural
                    heritage.
                    Whether it’s for Ganesh Chaturthi or a special occasion, I want every home to feel the divine
                    presence of
                    Lord
                    Ganesha in a way that respects both tradition and our planet.<br><br>

                    When you choose Sampada Kala Kendra, you’re not just bringing home a Ganesha idol—you’re joining me
                    in a
                    movement towards eco-friendly celebrations.
